    <h3 id = "title" > What is an ice cream ? </h3>
    <p class = "body_content">
        <strong> Ice cream </strong>is a <span class="edit"> rich</span>, <span class="edit"> sweet</span>, <span class="edit"> creamy</span> frozen food made from variously flavored cream and milk products churned or stirred to a smooth consistency during the freezing process and often containing gelatin, eggs, fruits, nuts, etc.
        It is typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id = "title" > What is it made of ?</h3>
    <p class = "body_content">
        It is made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a <span class="edit1"> sweetener</span>, either <span class="edit1"> sugar</span> or an alternative, and a spice, such as <span class="edit11"> cocoa</span> or <span class="edit1"> vanilla</span>, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. <span class="span_edits1"> Colorings</span> are sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
